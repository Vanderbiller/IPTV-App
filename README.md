## üéØ How It Works

1. **Flutter MethodChannel** (`video_player_channel`) sends a URL to `AppDelegate`.  
2. **AppDelegate** instantiates `PlayerViewController` from Storyboard and passes the URL.  
3. **PlayerViewController**:
   - Sets up `AVPlayer` + `AVPlayerLayer` for rendering.
   - Observes the player item‚Äôs status via KVO to detect live vs. VOD.
   - Configures UI controls, airplay button, and PiP controller.
   - Starts a periodic time observer to update the seek bar & lock-screen metadata.
   - Manages control‚Äêvisibility timers and gestures for a smooth UX.

## üîß Customization

- **Change Brand Colors**: Tweak `seekSlider.minimumTrackTintColor` / `maximumTrackTintColor` in `viewDidLoad()`.  
- **Adjust Auto-Hide Duration**: Modify `startUITimer()`‚Äôs 5-second interval.  
- **Badge Styling**: Edit `liveLabel`‚Äôs font, corner radius, or position in `configureLiveLabel()`.  
- **Artwork & Metadata**: Swap `"AppIcon"` in `setupNowPlayingInfo()` for your own image and adjust `MPMediaItemPropertyTitle`.
